##ManticoreDB

ManticoreDB is a WIP file based database managment system that presently interacts with data in table objects and stores them in .csv files.
The DB objects go Schema -> DB('s) -> Table('s)

All data is presently required to be a string.

This version was created to test making a DBMS' in golang and is not intended for usage.
